## Zero Knowledge Proofs
The ability to prove honest computation without reveiling the inputs.

## One-Shot Sync

## Merkle Tree

## Merkle Proofs

## PLONK

Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge (PLONK) is general-purpose zero knowledge proof scheme.

## Groth16

## PLONKY2

## CIRCOM

## SNARKs
Compact proof size and relatively short proof verification time, but circuit trust is required.

## STARKs

 Large proof size, absence of trusted setup requirement, and excellent scalability.

## Ligh Client Protocol

## Sync Comittee
