- guide how to build your own bridge smart contract
- asset bridge (token) / message bridge

DendrETH has been built with the intention to improve the existing blockchain bridge infrastructure by implementing a trust minimised, decentralised, secure smart contract solution. We believe that the future of blockchain is multichain, therefore we build an interoperability solution that is relying on the base layer of security, on protocol level, instead of relying on trusted operators. 
A bridge based on the light client sync protocol will authenticate all data through the signatures of the Ethereum validators participating in the sync committees, significantly reducing the required level of trust in the bridge operator and limiting the potential for attacks.
The DendrETH project aims to develop highly efficient Ethereum light client implementations in the form of smart contracts for multiple third-party blockchains such as Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, Cardano, Avalanche, Elrond, EOS, NEAR, Tezos and any EVM-compatible chain. It will explore and document different design trade-offs, based on the application of toolchains for fraud proofs and zero-knowledge proofs.
