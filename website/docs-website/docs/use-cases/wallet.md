### One-Shot Sync

Trustlessness is a fundamental concept in blockchain technology that allows for self-sovereign access to wealth and data. It refers to the ability of a blockchain network to function without the need for trust in any single entity, such as a central authority or intermediary. This is a key aspect of the decentralised nature of blockchain, which offers increased security, transparency, and autonomy to users.
RPC providers act as intermediaries between users and the Ethereum network, receiving requests for information or transactions from users, forwarding those requests to the Ethereum network, and returning the results to the user. This makes it easier for developers to build Ethereum applications and for users to access the Ethereum network without having to maintain their own nodes, which can be resource-intensive and technically complex. However, relying on centralised RPC servers requires trust in the providers. These providers have control over the data and transactions they process, which means they could potentially manipulate or censor the information and transactions that pass through their servers. 
DendrETH can be used as a stand alone solution or along with centralised RPC servers allowing users to independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data they receive from these providers, allowing the users to secure the accurate functioning of their applications(dApps).
